This application provides create, edit or delete comment as the only write functionality. This is because, Stack Exchange, the parent site, 
as of API version 2.1 exposes read only APIs for third party applications (except for comment). Please refer the API 
doc <a href="http://api.stackexchange.com/">here</a>.
</p>
<p> 
Because of these API write limitations you might notice there is no support to:
<ul type="disc">
<li>Ask a question</li>
<li>Answer a question</li>
<li>Accept an answer</li>
<li>Upvote or downvote</li>
<li>Favorite a question or answer</li>
<li>Mark unread inbox items as read after reading. Hence if notifications are enabled, for a new unread inbox item,
notification will be generated every time inbox synchronizes with the server even after having read it using third party API. Visiting 
<a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow</a> and marking the item as read will stop the notification from the application.</li>
</ul>
